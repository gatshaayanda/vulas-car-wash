# Vula's Car Wash — project instructions

## Source of truth
This is an existing customer-facing PWA adapted from the approved Iteration 13 foundation. GitHub `main`, this file, `README.md`, current Firebase rules and actual CI results are the source of truth. Preserve working PWA installation/offline behavior and implement the real Vula workflow in place; do not reclone the foundation.

## Product requirements
- Customer-first experience, staff operations second.
- Fixed-site booking and walk-in queue at the configured site; mobile service is a request until staff confirm coverage and capacity.
- Support individual customers and fleet enquiries.
- Service catalogue, gallery, customer booking history, loyalty balance, reminder preferences and live staff operations.
- Seed only known identity (Vula's Car Wash) and editable settings. Keep unconfirmed hours, address, prices, coverage and capacity as placeholders.
- No fake payment success. A customer can request online payment instructions, but payment gateway integration is not configured. Staff may mark payment only after verification.
- No fake booking confirmation. Requests are `requested` until staff confirm them.

## Current architecture
- Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Firebase Auth, Firestore, Firebase Storage, Firebase Cloud Messaging, service worker.
- Customer home: `src/app/page.tsx`; customer Firebase data layer: `src/lib/firebase/vula-data.ts`; push registration: `src/lib/firebase/vula-notifications.ts`.
- Staff route: `/admin`; gate: `src/app/admin/admin-gate.tsx`; operations: `src/app/admin/vula-dashboard.tsx`.
- Staff sign-in uses `/api/operations-login`, `FIREBASE_ADMIN_KEY`, and `VULA_OPERATIONS_WORD`. Never expose service-account credentials or staff secrets to the client.
- Collections: `admins`, `customers`, `services`, `gallery`, `businessSettings`, `bookings`, `queueEntries`, `fleetRequests`, `loyaltyAccounts`, `reminderPreferences`, and `notificationTokens`.
- Firestore authorization is in `firestore.rules`; image access is in `storage.rules`; indexes are in `firestore.indexes.json`.
- `public/sw.js` uses the isolated `vula-shell-v1` cache namespace. Keep early `beforeinstallprompt` capture and the explicit branded install click intact. iOS installation guidance is at `/iphone-install`.
- Legacy foundation routes redirect to the active customer or staff journey via `src/middleware.ts`.

## Online/offline rules
- Firestore client persistent cache is enabled.
- Offline booking/queue/fleet drafts are stored locally and retried with a stable document ID after reconnection or app reopen. Do not say the staff received them until the server write succeeds.
- A submitted request is not a confirmed booking. Only staff confirmation changes booking status.
- Anonymous Auth lets customers begin without forced registration. Linking an anonymous session to Google preserves its UID. Explain that unlinked guest data remains device/session dependent.
- Push reminders require `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY`, registered customer tokens, `FIREBASE_ADMIN_KEY`, `VULA_REMINDER_CRON_SECRET`, and GitHub Actions secrets for the scheduled job. Only confirmed bookings should receive reminders.
- Gallery uploads require the Firebase Storage rules to be published.
- Vula Racing currently uses device-local career storage. Its results, credits, promotion state and leaderboard are not server-synced or trusted; do not describe these as cross-device or public until a server-authoritative race API, owner-scoped persistence, and corresponding security tests are implemented. The `/admin` Games tab controls racing availability and the customer-facing notice through `businessSettings/main`.
- Do not claim Firebase rules/indexes or production deployment are live just because their files are committed.

## Implementation and verification
- Inspect the actual current code and relevant Firebase rules before changing data contracts.
- Keep Firestore rules aligned with the fields written by `src/lib/firebase/vula-data.ts` and the customer forms.
- Never loosen rules to public reads/writes to silence permission errors. Customers may read/write only their own records and preferences; loyalty balance, catalogue, gallery, settings and operational updates are staff controlled.
- Run `npm run verify:identity`, `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and `npm run build` where feasible. Inspect GitHub Actions results and fix regressions caused by changes.
- Protect secrets, avoid fake success messages, and report separately: code committed/pushed, checks passed, Firebase rules/indexes deployed, production deployment verified.
- At handoff, include exact commit, remaining configuration, known limitations and device QA steps. The product owner handles Vercel deployment unless explicitly delegated.
